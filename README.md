# Model Generator

The Model Generator is a command-line utility for generating code from an XML model definition file. It allows you to define your data model in XML and generate code in your desired programming language, reducing boilerplate code and simplifying development.

## Features

- Define your data model using a structured XML file.
- Generate code for classes, properties, and methods based on your XML model.
- Customize code generation templates to suit your specific requirements.
- Supports multiple programming languages and frameworks.

## Usage

To use the Model Generator, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   `git clone https://github.com/your-username/model-generator.git`

2. Navigate to the model-generator directory:

   `cd model-generator`

3. Prepare your XML model definition file. Ensure it follows the required format.

4. Run the Model Generator with the following command:

   `go run main.go -xml=model-definition.xml -template=model-template.hbs -output=output-directory`

        -xml: Specify the path to your XML model definition file.
        -template: Specify the path to your code generation template (in Handlebars format).
        -output: Specify the output directory where generated code will be saved.

5. Review the generated code in the output directory.

6. Customize the code generation template to match your specific project requirements, if needed.

## Example

Here's a simple example of an XML model definition file (model-definition.xml):

```xml
<model>
  <class name="Person">
    <properties>
      <property name="id" type="uuid" required="true" />
      <property name="name" type="string" />
      <property name="age" type="int" />
    </properties>
  </class>
</model>

```

And a code generation template (model-template.hbs):

```
class {{ name }} {
{{range .Properties}}
  public {{ name }}: {{ type }};
{{ end }}
}
```

Running the Model Generator with this setup will generate a class definition for Person in your chosen programming language.
Customization

You can customize the code generation templates to match your desired output format. Modify the template file (model-template.hbs) to generate code that suits your project's needs.
